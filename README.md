# notNumRoller


Ever needed a to roll two dice to get a random number, but wanted to forbid a number from coming up? No? Now you can.

This function simulates dice rolls but omits any combonation that quals the givn number, so your rolls still (somewhat) resemble a normal distrobution! 

You can try it on Tuesdays, or any other day of the week!
